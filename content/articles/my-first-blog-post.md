title: Blog Post 0 - Impulse buy to Website
description: Vuejs, Nuxtjs and Netlify!
content: After finding out alexruiz.com was taken, my fellow developer and friend Cam, suggested I purchase the domain of alexruiz.dev and not giving myself a second to think I quickly purchased it. Once I had, I started to get excited to work on a site all my own and got to work. First month was the slowest, while I had worked with Vuejs and Nuxtjs at work, its a whole other experience to start a website from scratch. But after reading documentation after documentation pages and numerous blog posts, I finally had enough of a website to replace the single html file that was alexruiz.dev for over a month. Using Netlify for quick and easy deployments it was a breeze to set up the site. Now, why a blog with your portfolio site? In all honesty it's for two reasons, -- One. A lot of the devs I admire and follow on Twitter have blog portfolio sites that I like to read. Two. There is a very well documented Vuejs+Nuxtjs tutorial on building a blog site. It'll be interesting to see how the mark up files evolve as i ge used to it. I'm hoping to add more blog posts along with other functionalities to this site as well, so keep an eye out! Thank you for reading!
