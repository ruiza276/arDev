      <h1 class="title">About Me...</h1>
      <p>Hello Hi my name is Alex Ruiz. I'm a Software Engineer based in the Chicago-land area (Ask me about MalÃ¶rt or for a coffee shop recommendation!).</p>
      <h2 class="title"> The Past â˜•</h2>
      <p>Before becoming a Software Engineer, I was a electronics technician with a decent talent in IPhone screen repairs and before that I was a barista, slinging out Instagram worthy lattes. 
        Even got third place in a latte art competition that I entered by accident.</p>
      <p>I graduated from DePaul University with a B.S, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Development and a minor in Data Analysis and Data Mining. 
        I was very disappointed to learn that the mouthful that is my major and minor would not be printed on the physical copy of my degree.</p>
      <h2 class="title"> The Present and Beyond ðŸ“Š</h2>
      <p>Nowadays I work in primarily .NET and all related technologies. building features, apps,  debugging, etc. 
Going forward, I would love to one day leverage my Data Mining knowledge professionally. I absolutely love working with data and all the cool insights that are waiting to be discovered. </p>
